    <h1>AvatarInfection</h1>
</div>

A Fusion gamemode where a virus is released, but it's rather special... It turns the infected people into a selected avatar! This gamemode offers a lot of customazibility compared to other gamemodes.

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

- Ability to set any avatar of your choice to be the infected
- Fully customizable stats for both Infected and Survivors, and Infected Children if you decide to use them
- Ability to disable the usage of guns for teams
- Most of the things are handled server-side, making the gamemode less vulnerable to cheaters
- Two types of infection: TOUCH and DEATH
- **and much, much more**

**Lakatrazz** - This gamemode is a heavily modified version of the included in Fusion gamemode Hide & Seek which was made by Lakatrazz.
