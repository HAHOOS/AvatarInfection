Hi!

If you are trying to modify the code, good luck.
It's so good that you will cry while trying to fix anything.
Though 20 commits ago or 30 you would have given up just by looking at the Infection.cs file.
It used to be 2000 lines of code, 2 fucking thousand lines of code.

I wish you good luck.

You will suffer while trying to do this.

Edit: Fuck this code.

Regards,
